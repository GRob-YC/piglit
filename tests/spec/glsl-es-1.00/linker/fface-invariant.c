/** @file fface-invariant.c
 *
 * The OpenGL ES Shading Language 1.00 specification says:
 *
 *    "(4.6.4 Invariance and Linkage): [...]
 *     It is an error to declare gl_FrontFacing as invariant.  The invariance
 *     of gl_FrontFacing is the same as the invariance of gl_Position."
 *
 * Most of the errors in this section must be enforced at link time, but
 * disallowing the invariant qualifier on gl_FrontFacing could easily be
 * done as a compile time error (and earlier is usually preferable).  We
 * allow either in this test.
