/**
 * Test i965 guardband limits by drawing a really huge triangle.  The
 * guardband allows primitives to be trivially accepted by the clip stage
 * without incurring the overhead of actual clipping.  However, there are
 * generation-specific limits on the size of a primitive, and software is
 * supposed to ensure that clipping reduces primitives to not exceed that.
 * Otherwise, coordinates are clamped to fit within that range, causing
 * the primitive to be drawn incorrectly.
 *
 * This makes sure we program the guardband size correctly; otherwise, the
 * triangle's vertices will be clamped instead of clipped, resulting in a
 * change in position and slope.
