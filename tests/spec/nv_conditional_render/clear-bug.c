/**

 *
 * Tests that conditional rendering appropriately affects glClear().
 * Demonstrates a bug in iris where the driver recorded a conditional
 * clear as having occurred although it does not.
 *
 * From the NV_conditional_render spec:
 *
 *     "If the result (SAMPLES_PASSED) of the query is zero, all
 *      rendering commands between BeginConditionalRenderNV and the
 *      corresponding EndConditionalRenderNV are discarded.  In this
 *      case, Begin, End, all vertex array commands performing an
 *      implicit Begin and End, DrawPixels (section 3.6), Bitmap
 *      (section 3.7), Clear (section 4.2.3), Accum (section 4.2.4),
 *      CopyPixels (section 4.3.3), EvalMesh1, and EvalMesh2 (section
 *      5.1) have no effect."
